# Project-Puzzle2
## Mobile casual game testing with voxel-based aesthetics.

This is a small mobile game I was developing on the side. The goal is to ‘push’ animals with mobile taps into their corresponding barn houses while under a timer. The game was going to feature various animals that require specific needs in order to be moved efficiently. However as of now, only chicks hatching from eggs are functional.

The game was going to have both perceptually generated levels combined with authored levels. Currently, only fence perimeter sizes are randomized. Future implementations of levels include placing barn houses at different locations and spawning animals at random locations with weight quantities.
